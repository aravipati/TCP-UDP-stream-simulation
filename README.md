## TCP-UDP stream-simulation
###### TCP/UDP stream simulation server is coded in C# (visual studio) 
###### TCP/IP and UDP client apps are coded in java (Eclipse IDE & ANDROID sdk)
###### Server sends bytes of data when TCP clients are connected to it and data packets when UDP clients are connected to it.
###### Delay occurred in stream transfer from server to client can be calculated using server and TCP app setup. 
###### Number of packets lost can be calculated using server and UDP app setup.
